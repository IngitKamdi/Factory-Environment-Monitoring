Problem Statement Title:	Factory Environment Monitoring
The proposed system will leverage LoRa for long-range communication and Wi-Fi for local data access to monitor environmental conditions in a factory. It will collect real-time data on air quality, temperature, humidity, and noise levels. By integrating with an IoT platform like Thingsboard, Thingspeak & Grafana, the system will provide enhanced data visualization and analytics, enabling timely interventions and ensuring a safe work environment.
